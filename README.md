# energy_dataset
Each folder has 2 files
1 with basic block code with each basic block corresponding to a specific unique id
1 with basic block energies corresponding to the bb with the same id as previous file

if energy of bb =0 discard bb



When we have a basic block that has a unique first number  for example basic block 6_0 when there is no other 6_x bb and the projected energy is too big > 30 then it is better to discard it
